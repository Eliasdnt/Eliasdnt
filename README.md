# Hi, I'm Elias ðŸ‘‹
 
## About Me
<p>Hello! I am a student passionate about technology and development, currently studying Computer Science in the second semester. From an early age, I was captivated by the world of computing and programming, and this passion only grew over the years.

My journey in technology began as a hobby, through a technical course, exploring different programming languages â€‹â€‹and experimenting with personal projects. Over time, I realized that my true calling was creating innovative solutions through software development.

During my studies, I have sought to improve my skills in programming, algorithms and data structures, always seeking to understand not only how things work, but also the why behind each line of code. I believe that the combination of theory and practice is essential for the development of a successful professional in the computing field.
I look forward to continuing my academic and professional journey, exploring new challenges and opportunities that allow me to expand my knowledge and positively impact the world through technology.</p>

## Projects

Personal Portfolio:
I'm dedicating time and effort to develop a portfolio that represents my journey in the field of Computer Science and software development. This project will not only showcase my technical skills but also reflect my design style and creativity. I'm excited to share my progress and completed projects soon.

Academic Works:
As a second-semester Computer Science student, I'm involved in various academic projects covering everything from algorithms and data structures to system development and data analysis. I'm committed to delivering high-quality work that demonstrates my understanding of computer science theories and practices.

NDS Lab:
I actively participate in activities at the NDS lab, where I have the opportunity to collaborate with other students and researchers on practical and challenging projects. We're working on initiatives spanning areas such as Front-end and Back-end development. This experience has been crucial for my professional and academic development.

In addition to these projects, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, whether through online courses, participation in hackathons, or contributions to open-source projects. I look forward to sharing the results of these efforts and continuing to grow as a professional in the technology field.

## Professional Experience

During my 5-month internship at Vicunha Textil in the IT department, I gained valuable experience in resolving IT tickets, creating reports through database queries, and actively participating in the company's processes. This role allowed me to collaborate effectively as a computer technician, contributing to the smooth functioning of IT systems and providing technical support to users.

In addition to my professional experience at Vicunha TÃªxtil, I am also actively involved in the NDS laboratory (Software Development Center). This involvement provided me with opportunities to work on cutting-edge projects. I collaborated with a diverse team of researchers and students, contributing my technical skills and gaining practical experience in advanced technologies.

These experiences not only improved my technical skills, but also developed my ability to work in multidisciplinary teams, solve problems efficiently and adapt to dynamic work environments.
